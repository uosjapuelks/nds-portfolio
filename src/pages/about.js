            Hey there! I am a Final Year Computer Engineering student at the National University of Singapore expected to graduate in August 2024
            I have great interest in and enjoy tinkering with technology, particularly with Software Engineering or related fields such as Machine Learning (or Artificial Intelligence)
            Academics aside, I also partake in a multitude of co-curricular activities to hone my soft skills.
